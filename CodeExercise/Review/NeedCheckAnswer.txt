///75. Sort Colors
///https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/
///Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
///Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
///
///Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
///
///Example:
///
///Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
///Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
///
/// sol:
/// (1)A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
/// First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
/// (2)use "zeroIdx" :0   and "twoIdx": len-1, 
///    hit 1, i++,  
///    hit 0  swap(i++, zeroIdx++),
///    hit 2, swap(i, twoIdx--)  only, keep i for next check,

[code]
 while(i <= twoIdx)    // yic must be <=     for example [1,2,0] -> after first swap [1,0,2]  twoidx = 1, i = 1 as well
{
    if (colors[i] == 0)
    {
        // only hit 0 itself or 1 need to swap,
        swap(colors, i, zeroIdx++);
        i++;
    }
    else if (colors[i] == 2)
    {
        swap(colors, i, twoIdx--);  // we don't know what to swap back, so keep the same i
    }
    else
    {
        // 1 case , keep going
        i++;
    }
